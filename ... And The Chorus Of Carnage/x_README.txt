--+ Explanation of new feature (to qualify for bonus points) +--

- The "Dash Roll" is triggered by holding left or right and hitting the "P" key.
- Dash Rolling grants a short window of invincibility and increased speed - the player rolls
  left or right depending on the direction being held when they activated it.
	- The exact length of the invinciblity/speed window is .3 seconds.
- Dash Rolling can be used to get out of tight spots that you would normally take damage in, or move you across the screen faster.
- Dash Rolling has a recharge time of 1 second.
- An indicator in the bottom right corner of the gameplay screen shows when the player can use the Dash Roll.

- Technically, the introduction of multiple endings based on how many waves you clear is also a new mechanic, but it's
  not gameplay related. Regardless: clearing 3 or more waves will get you a different game over screen. The game is balanced 
  to make that achievement reasonably difficult.

This is all explained with more glee and whimsy in the Instruction Manual, but I know there's a lot of these to grade, so this is a short version that's less entertaining. Happy holidays!
